    "description": "Sveriges Riksbank, located in Stockholm, is the central bank of Sweden. The Riksbank’s main tasks are to ensure that inflation is low and stable over time, contribute to the stability and efficiency of the financial system, and make sure that payments can be made. Economists at the Riksbank’s Research Division conduct research in areas of importance to the Riksbank. The Division also organises academic conferences, hosts an international seminar series, and has an active visitors program.\n\nThe Research Division invites applications for our internship program for PhD students in Economics, Finance or Statistics at Swedish or foreign universities. The selected interns will spend a period of two to three months at the Riksbank – either at the Research Division or at a policy department – during the period April to June or the period September to November 2026. The monthly salary offered is SEK 34,000. The Riksbank will cover expenses for economy-class travel to Stockholm, but not expenses for housing.\n\nThe purpose of the internship program is to give PhD students an opportunity to interact with Riksbank researchers and other staff, while conducting research into issues broadly relevant to the Riksbank. Students should therefore have finished the first-year course work of their PhD programs and started working on their dissertation\n\nInterns assigned to the Research Division will focus on advancing their dissertation research and may also initiate collaborative projects with economists in the division when they share common research interests. Interns placed in a policy department may also be involved in directed research projects. Interns are expected to present their achievements in a seminar towards the end of their stay.\n\nMore information about the Research Division and research activities at the Riksbank is available at our website: https://www.riksbank.se/en-gb/about-the-riksbank/the-tasks-of-the-riksbank/research. \n\nApplications should arrive no later than 18 January 2026. Please indicate in a cover letter: (a) the preferred starting date (April or September) and the preferred duration (two or three months); and (b) if you are interested primarily in the Research Division or in joining one of the policy departments (monetary policy, financial stability, markets or payments). Include also a curriculum vitae, a document from your university department listing completed courses in the PhD program, as well as a brief description of the project(s) that you propose to work on. A finished paper is considered an extra qualification. One letter of recommendation from a supervisor or other person at your department familiar with your studies should be sent directly to research@riksbank.se no later than 18 January 2026. Successful candidates will be notified by early February 2026.\n\nFurther information can be obtained from Ulf Söderström, Head of Research (ulf.soderstrom@riksbank.se).",

De sökta utbildningarna är: Fartygstekniker, Cybersäkerhetsanalytiker, Upphandlare & Inköpare, Stödpedagog inom funktionshinderområdet, Specialistundersköterska inom vård och omsorg av äldre. Tjänsten kan komma att innehålla ansvar för YH-kurser. Erfarenhet av både program och YH-kurser är därför meriterande. \n\nUtbildningsledaren är på Campus Nynäshamn den studerandes kontaktperson, ledningsgruppens verkställare och ansvarig för att kursledare och föreläsare levererar utbildning av god kvalitet i linje med gällande utbildnings- och kursplan. Ditt arbete kring de studerandes LIA är även en viktig del. Du är i din roll som utbildningsledare ansvarig för att din utbildning har god genomströmning och håller god kvalitet. I rollen ingår antagning, budgetansvar, upphandling av utbildare samt uppföljning och systematiskt kvalitetsarbete. Som utbildningsledare arbetar du digitalt i olika system, såsom MYH:s Mina sidor, It’s learning, Alvis och Office 365.\n\nUtbildningsledaren har en koordinerande, administrativ, kommunikativ, stödjande och verkställande roll. Utbildningsledaren har det samordnade ansvaret för utbildningens genomförande vilket ska ske enligt lag och förordningen om yrkeshögskolan. Huvudmålet är att de studerande ska bli efterfrågade inom den bransch som utbildningen är kopplad till. Du kommer eventuellt ha ansvar för helt nystartade utbildningar inom yrkeshögskola men det kan bli befintlig utbildning. \n\nAlla YH-program och kurser på Campus Nynäshamn är på distans vilket gör att arbetet som utbildningsledare kan utföras mestadels på distans var som helst i Sverige. I alla program ingår det dock 1-2 närträffar per termin i Nynäshamn som du som utbildningsledare förväntas vara med på. Därtill kan det tillkomma Campusgemensamma- eller kommungemensamma träffar någon gång per år.\n\nFlexibiliteten i arbetet är något som ofta lyfts hos våra medarbetare, men även det värdefulla med att ses fysisk. Vi på Campus försöker kombinera de båda världarna.   \n\nOm arbetsplatsen\nCampus Nynäshamn är en kommunal verksamhet och Nynäshamns kommun är din arbetsgivare. Det är en stor utbildningsverksamhet med drygt 50 anställda. Campus tillhandahåller fyra olika utbildningsformer: Högre Utbildning, Komvux/SFI, YH och NY. Det finns gemensamma funktioner på Campus exempelvis administration, SYV, studiestöd och utvecklingsteam. \n\nSom Campus inom en kommunal verksamhet finns det även tillgång till hela kommunens stödfunktioner eller förmåner såsom upphandlingsenhet, HR, friskvårdskonsult eller möjlighet att på semestern hyra stuga.   \n\nNäringslivs- och arbetsmarknadsförvaltningens uppdrag är att stärka Nynäshamns kommun som en attraktiv plats för företagare. Vi tillgodoser behovet av kompetens genom att erbjuda unga och vuxna utbildningar på Nynäshamns gymnasium och Campus Nynäshamn.
